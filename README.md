# Joker Jail Break

This is a single player game.

The Joker is trapped between the Walls and Pillars.

The objective of the game is to free the Joker, by clearing one of the walls

Walls are cleared by playing Red vs Black cards. A play is valid if the total value of Red cards is the same as the Black cards.

A = 1, J = 11, Q = 12, K = 13

Both the Walls and Pillars can be cleared, but the Joker can only be freed by clearing the Walls.
